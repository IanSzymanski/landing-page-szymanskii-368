# landing-page-szymanskii-368
freeCodeCamp Certification Project about building a product landing page.

I had a lot of fun with this one, and really tried to challenge myself. But in the process of challenging myself, I created something that I am really proud of. Not to sound braggadocious, but I wouldn't even say that this was that hard. I knew what I was doing for every section, and it was like building a lego set. Flex box is like a magic wand that fixes all of my formatting.
